What is Data Science?

Data Science involves analyzing and manipulating data—whether text, image, audio, or video—to predict future use cases and provide reasonable suggestions through recommendation systems.

Data Science vs AI vs ML

Data Science: Encompasses Mathematics, Statistics, Visualization, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). These form the foundational elements for both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Involves training systems to make their own decisions based on data. It essentially gives a machine a "brain" to autonomously make decisions. Examples include Amazon Echo and Google Assistant.

Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI focused on making recommendations based on provided data or past occurrences. Examples include movie recommendations on Netflix and product suggestions on Amazon.

Hierarchical Relationship

AI (Artificial Intelligence): The broadest field, encompassing all forms of intelligence exhibited by machines.
ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI, dedicated to developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from and make predictions based on data.
Deep Learning: A subset of ML, utilizing neural networks to solve complex problems.

Note: The hierarchy can be visualized as AI > ML > Deep Learning, with each subset focusing on more specific aspects of machine intelligence. Deep Learning leverages neural networks to address intricate issues, making it a powerful tool within the broader AI and ML domains.
