 Date and Time Functions in Excel

Excel stores dates and times as serial numbers, but you can use various functions to work with them in a user-friendly way. Here are some commonly used functions:

1. DATE:

Purpose: Constructs a date from separate year, month, and day values. 
Syntax: `=DATE(year, month, day)`
Example: `=DATE(2024, 7, 17)` returns today's date (assuming you're entering the formula today, July 17, 2024).

2. DAY:

Purpose: Extracts the day of the month from a date.
Syntax: `=DAY(cell_name)`
Example: If cell A1 contains the date `=DATE(2024, 7, 17)`, then `=DAY(A1)` returns `17`.

3. EDATE:

Purpose: Adds or subtracts a specified number of months from a starting date.
Syntax: `=EDATE(start_date, months)`
Example: `=EDATE(TODAY(), 3)` returns the date three months from today.

4. WEEKDAY:

Purpose: Returns the day of the week (represented as a number) for a given date.
Syntax: `=WEEKDAY(cell_name)`
     By default, Sunday = 1 and Saturday = 7. You can adjust this behavior using a second optional argument.
Example: `=WEEKDAY(A1)` (where A1 contains a date) might return `3` (Wednesday).

5. HOUR:

Purpose: Extracts the hour value from a time.
Syntax: `=HOUR(cell_name)`
Example: If a cell contains `=TIME(15, 30, 0)`, then `=HOUR(cell_name)` returns `15`.

6. MINUTE:

Purpose: Extracts the minute value from a time.
Syntax: `=MINUTE(cell_name)`
Example: Using the same cell from the HOUR example, `=MINUTE(cell_name)` returns `30`.
